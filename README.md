This program will automate "Google Search". These are the follwing things it will do:

1. It will take a KEYWORD from Excel Sheet based on the current week day. 
   (Example: If today is Friday, it will take the KEYWORDS from Fridays sheet.)

2. Then, it will search all the keywords from the sheet one by one. 

3. For every keyword search it will take the "Shortest" and "Longest" search result.

4. After that it will store the "Shortest" and "Longest" search result on the same excel sheet for that keyword.
